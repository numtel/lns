"Are you calling me boring?! That would be the worst!"

Sam Altman knocked on my door today, the OpenAI guy, the CEO of the company that makes ChatGPT, and who I had long cursed for my conspiratorial belief that his opinions on startup culture prevented me from getting many startup jobs for which I interviewed at various YCombinator-incubated companies in San Francisco. Of course, I probably overestimated his influence over other Silicon Valley business people.

It's always fun having a well-known rich person knock on the door. It sure beats having someone you've never heard of but has to fulfill their capital gains tax resolution.

We can have them do whatever work we need done around the house but it's generally understood that anyone sitting on top of a billion dollars gets to clean the toilets.

At that level, their community service hours per week reaches the maximum, 80. You'd be amazed at how hard some people work so they can have that much money of their own. The power of such wealth is so enticing but not too many aren't persuaded fairly quickly to reduce their hoard with all the chores they're made to do.

It was a compromise bill that we got passed but most people are satisfied with it. The addition of the clause for getting their work done with a positive demeanor and a smile made most of us change to a supporting vote. Modifications might still need to be made.

I invite him in. He looks just like in videos but a bit frazzled. My neighbor had the bright idea to ask ChatGPT for help in his spiel that he read for the entire hour while he had Sam scrubbing his tub and polishing his toilet bowl. Apparently the prompt was something like: "Write a rant to be read to Sam Altman about how his chat bot is boring and make it especially unbearable to him to hear. Exploit his pyschological weaknesses!"

With all this outside help around the house, I've been able to focus on my own creative projects.

Our cultural perception of personal wealth has really changed over the last year since enacting this law. There's not many people speaking out against it. Everyone can innately feel the joy in taking the piss out of someone richer than them. Well, that and having them take out the garbage.
