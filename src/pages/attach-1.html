It's what language has led us on.

We can feel it. We know it happens.

We just don't know how.

Sure, we have theories

But they're all bullshit.

Love, socialism, communism, be good to your neighbor

It's all beating around the bush.

There's a method for directly linking thoughts in one body with another.

Or at least that's what they tell me.

And I believe them. My colleague, Jamie, and I did an experiment during our last survey expedition.

I was following one member of their group as he hunted while Jamie stayed back at their camp.

At the same moment he killed a deer, Jamie recorded that they knew the hunt was successful and began preparing to butcher and cook the animal.

This was an emotional moment for the hunter and his kin so maybe that gives the thought extra power.

But what caught my attention was when he returned that night and his wife danced in front of him in a blue dress as a joke. There had been a blue beetle flying right in front of him for over a kilometer that day while we walked. Swatting with his arms as he almost inhaled it several times, he was so annoyed by it.

His wife had seen all this through his eyes and decided to have a little fun.

Even these examples could be misconstrued as mere coincidence though.

My colleagues continued on their survey as I stayed with this interesting (to me) group.

I observed them for a few weeks, becoming convinced they were like one entity living through multiple bodies. I would see one of them hide something under a stone then another retrieve the item days later without any searching.

Then I got glimpses. I felt like a part of their group. I was on their level.

I could see the stones that covered the secret caches. I knew when the hunt was successful, and when it wasn't.

I couldn't tell you what had changed inside me. Was it a look deep into my eyes they gave? Was it some kind of vibration? Was it my strong desire to know and their reciprocal desire to have me join them?

It faded as soon as I returned to my colleagues in the city. The whole anthropology department thinks I've lost it.

But I don't care because I know what I felt.
