<h1>I am Crow now</h1>
<article>
Those crows are out there, living it up. I see them when I leave for work, when I get back. They get all they need without having to pay for it.

I scrape by for pennies doing deliveries.




I lay down. Sleep is supposed to happen. Then it will be the next day. A full set of 3 meals and 8 glasses of water. It’s another rotation of this planet.

I don’t want that. I want something different. I don’t care about sleeping and being rested for tomorrow. I want to be a crow.

“Oh get out of here! You don’t belong here! Shoo crow,” my wife wakes me up with a dreadful fright.

She’s afraid to touch me as she waves her arms around and gestures toward the window she has opened. There’s no choice. I leave.

Crow has no need of house.
Crow does not need wife.
Crow belong here as little as wife think I do.

The world is new. It’s below me as I rise now.
The human world passes.
It is of little interest to crow.




I join two crows in a park, pecking and hopping around.
They're hungry just eating the odd bug and worm.
I can help them. I'll get the sandwich from the woman on the bench.
Humans love animals acting like they do, so crow dance.
She puts down the prize to record a video, practically giving it to me.
My new companions’ suspicion turns to admiration.

We steal more and more. Our heists get bigger. We live like kings, fat and happy.
The humans take notice. Fellow crows are coming back injured from their defenses.
A truce is made. We’ll work for them in exchange for their amazing food.
It’s a matter of specialization. We can deliver things for them much faster and easier than they can themselves.

This doesn’t sit right.
Crows slave like humans just to be comfortable.
Can’t we do something to break this cycle?
We’re all just trying to get what we can out of this world.

I strike a deal. We’ll train pigeons to do deliveries then crows will be considered pets like cats and dogs. They’ll feed us just because they like us.
How’s this any better?

Why not live like we used to? I wish every transformation were reversible.
