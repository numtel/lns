I was up late scrolling, when I found something I knew my friend would like, "Hey Kayla, check out this article in Nature. Scientists found a population of mice that eat seeds from a type of grass that seems to give them special powers. They're able to organize themselves and do more complex things than other mice. They were able to isolate a novel compound that's similar to harmine, or as it was originally called, telepathine."

Of course she was up too, and she knows her plants. A few minutes later, she responds, "I've seen that grass growing around here. Let's go out tomorrow and I'll show it to you. I'll pick you up."

She's always down for an adventure. I don't know what seeing the grass will do but it should be fun anyways.

&mdash;

Kayla picks me up and we drive about a half hour to a spot in what seems like the middle of nowhere then we start walking. After almost an hour of walking she points, "There it is!"

It looked just like the picture in the article. There was a whole field of it and it was even producing seeds. Kayla tested one and said it tasted fine, not bitter. I tried a few and agreed. We collected handfuls and put them in my bag.

After another hour walking in the forest, neither of us felt any stomach discomfort from the seeds. Kayla turns to me and proposes, "C'mon Sabrina let's eat them all and see what happens."

I'm a bit apprehensive to eat some plant seeds with no documented use by humans but they didn't seem to cause the mice any problems. I give her the nod and we split our harvest into two piles then have ourselves a little picnic.

They do taste good. Almost like eating sunflower seeds but crunchier. We have no idea what's going to happen, if anything.

After we get moving again, I have to pee so I step off the trail and hide behind a bush when I can hear Kayla yell out, "Don't pee on that mushroom!"

There's no way she could see it from where she was, "How'd you know I was going to pee on the mushroom?"

"I saw it like a flash in my mind. Like how you see something in a dream and instantly know more about it.

"You think it's the seeds?"

"Could be. Let's try something. I'm going to walk over there then I'll come back in a few minutes."

Kayla was gone for more than a few minutes but I wasn't worried. I had a strong intuition I could find her if I put my feet in motion.

She gets back and asks, "What's in my pocket?"

I can't resist the joke, "Are we playing hide the sausage?"

But then, without thinking, I say, "6 dandelions."

"Exactly!"

Now we believe it.

"What can we do with this?"

"Go gambling while the other looks at people's cards?"

"No that's boring. Let's save the world."
