Look at all the things you can buy with money!

On this planet, we are enforced to buy and sell everything.

If you decide not to buy and sell, they will call you a savage and treat you as they do other animals.

I want that that cannot be sold.

I doubt it could be bought either.

A place where resource extraction never happens

because all interested parties are self-sufficient.

Their bodies produce what they need







I'm going for the operation. I'm excited about the change. Today I receive an injection on my chest from where my new body will grow.

In about a week, I'll have a good sized pimple poking out off my belly. It'll be a month before the legs and arms will be able to move.

This new one has a kind of green lizard skin that I want to try. They say it can be almost fully autotrophic. Chloroplasts fill the skin and since it will only grow to be a few inches tall, it will only need to eat in rare circumstances of high physical output.

After two months, I've got good control of walking it around with the cord still attached. Experiencing its senses has been slower but I'm working on it. I want to be able to cut the cord soon.

The time has come. I can fully transfer my awareness to the small green body that I've had walking over me for the last 6 months. I believe the psychological link is strong enough that, even without the cord, I'll still be able to maintain the link.

Freedom from the big body and from the need to feed myself! I spend all my awareness in the new body. My old clunky, hungry, giant body is but a distant memory. I wonder where it went.






When our mastery over the genetic code becomes this powerful, allowing conscious control and design over our individual biological hardware, where will we go?





I'm going to be rich! This new restaurant I'm going to open will be huge!

I've got all the workers growing in the facility now. I check in each week, connecting into their experiences as they develop.

When they're ready, we can open and I probably won't have to log into any of them to modify any behaviors more than a few times each year.

It's really a win for everybody. The dishes are very well made and at a good price.





It's not that each body watches its experience. You could move into a new body and leave an old one behind to its own devices. What are you to say? Do you believe that you have control over your actions and that you're not just watching a feed of experiences?

Or you could grow bodies as machines and only experience their perspectives when modifying their behavior. Because you assume no one else is experiencing their perspectives, so they can be like slaves? Your leg is a slave to your brain; is it not?






I wanted to help people, so I decided to become a piece of useful infrastructure.

There was a lot of traffic over the existing bridges on the river coming through the big city.

I found a place equidistant between two other bridges and swallowed the capsules. This is where I set down roots.

My feet become stuck and my legs woody and long. I now clear the span over the river and soon I will be a viable path for humans.

In a year, you'll be able to take an ox-pulled cart over my full-grown trunk.

I'll never get rid of my old torso, head, and arms though. It's too nice greeting the passersby.




The future is weirder than you can imagine.

But it's coming and even death won't save you.





He thought he was deep in his own head. But then his head broke and he was still experiencing.

It turns out he was something else, something existing, even without a body.


But he could get interested in another body.

This is the wacky story of one man's journey through the genetic playground of the future.

Each of the above snippets are different bodies that one guy decides to grow and inhabit, each with varying outlooks towards a good life.

He moves on before each body dies, never paying special attention to what happens to old bodies, (they continue living and carrying on without him watching, i.e. the experience is separate from the action, consciousness is like watching tv, it makes you wonder, what is so amazing about this specific body that I'm paying attention to it over all the other bodies? main character meme) a mental telepathy that weakens over time of not experiencing a particular body's senses.

Like how scientists grew a human ear on the back of a mouse but much more: (of course, that was just the shape of an ear; the mouse did not gain any auditory sensations) any designer body could be grown as appendage to the body as new parts to be learned to control and spread into consciousness. A pathway to immortality that suggests that our consciousness is more fluid than we realize.

This fluidity is a consequence of a deterministic non-freewill existence.

Old religions are all about free will. They place all the weight on the individual. Adam and Eve chose to eat that apple. Do unto others as you wish for yourself. These maxims become true if you believe them.

The finding that our brains know our choices multiple seconds before we are aware of them ourselves is a big crack in the freewill orthodoxy.

How it ends: After going through all these bodies, he finally dies without having any replacement bodies still available to experience and he's sent to watch from the eyes of someone he knew.

Not as punishment but in order to illustrate that death isn't what it seems and that our attractions to certain people determines these affinities.

So I obviously left off the hedonistic tale of people growing their own harems. This fact of life should be reflected in the storytelling though.

We're evolving constantly

We are reaching towards the stars

We will live in space away from planets


The problem with spending too much time in space that you lose muscle mass and bone density because there's no gravity. This is a problem when you return to earth.

So the solution is to stay in zero-g forever.

Human body adapts over generations into a new simpler form, eventually becoming tolerant of existing in vacuum.


I want to dream of "mad-scientist" genetic experiments.

Can we grow a frog out of the side of a mouse then separate and have 2 living beings?

Can we make a frog (or mouse) replicate by division, like a single cell does?

Hypothetical scenario:

1. Scientist guy succeeds in getting a mouse to divide like a cell. Both mice are clones and seem to share experiences. ("Twin effect" on steroids!) In experiment, mouse #1 is shown food while mouse #2 is isolated and cannot see or smell it but comes for the food at the same moment anyways.

2. Successful replication in dogs, horses, cats

3. He has to know how it feels so he secretly performs the procedure on himself in his lab.

4. He finds that he can see and feel through both bodies

5. Soon, everybody has copies and not just exact clones but other animals and different human bodies.

In "The New Capitalism TM," nobody hires workers, they grow them and remain conscious of them. (Robots turned out to be unnecessary)

People are filling giant habitats in space with all their progeny

Tight restrictions on self-duplication are adopted on earth. Huge fees for permit to produce a human body. Very small fees for insects, fish, birds.

We expand our consciousness and rebuild nature.

Everybody is immortal
Procreation the natural way is very rare
Nobody's age matters anymore

Bodies that have stems and leaves for energy supply
A human with a huge canopy
That never has to eat
Breathitarianism is real, man!

All your movements, etc
That's just your sentience
i.e. the same thing that single bacteria have

So what's consciousness?
It's just the observation
There may be a power to suppress actions

But all ideas, thoughts, movements, feelings arise from processes of sentience.

The body encounters so much
The consciousness selects what to silence (filter)
In order to feed an experience back to the sentient nervous system to make its decisions/actions

And my hypothesis is that
  sexual reproduction produces a new observer
while
  asexual reproduction does not

This explains "unconscious" humans
"Consciousness" is not something everybody realizes how to operate
It's the wisdom of when to say no
It's taste

The taste of a person
Everybody has a taste
It's the sum of the parts
And consumption is the acceptance of a body

The consumption of farmed animals
incorporates their experiences into one's own: Unflinching authority

Cheap shot: That's why trump eats mcdonalds

In the book Tryptamine Palace, the Bose-Einstein Condensate hypothesis of consciousness is presented.

In special conditions, a group of atoms (matter) condenses and acts as a single wave.

To produce this effect in a lab, the temperature must be set to almost absolute zero.

This has been done in zero-g on the ISS with great effect and duration.

The author describes a hypothesis that all life activates this (difficult-to-study) state of matter in its own molecules: supreme coherency

"Strassman points out a fascinating corollary between human development and the Tibetan belief system. In development, the forty-nine days it takes for the pineal to appear corresponds to the same period it takes for a fetus to first display its gender and thus, one could argue its identity or ego. This is exactly the same amount of days that the Tibetan buddhists--who have by far the most sophisticated belief system with regard to the soul's passage after dying--believe elapse before the beginning of the 'bardo of becoming.' That is, it takes forty-nine days before a soul reincarnates into a new physical form if it failed to gain enlightenment."

"...there is no spirituality in any aspect of our contemporary Western civilization. Our religious life is ethical, not mystical." - Joseph Campbell

If asexual reproduction does not produce a new observer,
and since it took billions (?) of years for sexual reproduction to appear in living beings,
all existing living beings produced asexual are experienced by a single observer: The Gaian Mind
(They may even be better referred to as a single being with many independent bodies)

This great observer was the original and still persists to this day
It will persist for a long time
It may be THE [absolute] original

Act 1:
  No knowledge of problem:
    Protagonist goes for a meal and notices that the staff is extremely well coordinated
      As soon as he makes a request to the server, the kitchen staff begins working without any further communication
  Limited knowledge of problem:
    News reports of people being caught for crimes with seemingly no witnesses
  Knowledge of problem:
    Intrepid reporter leaks story that a secretive biotech company has perfected technique for asexual reproduction
    Turns out that military has filled entire battalions with "clones"
  
Act 2:
  Refusal to acknowledge problem:
    Conservative backlash, Dr. Moreau comparisons
  Beginning to acknowledge problem:
    Rich people start producing clones, harems
  Acknowledging problem:
    Process is available to general public
  
Act 3:
  Experimenting with knowledge of problem:
    Expansion from 'same-species' clones into new bodies of all other animals, plants
  Midpoint:
    Revelation of the gaian mind
  Experimenting with key knowledge of problem:
    Expansion of process into bacteria, other single cells that always divided asexually in order to feel as Gaia would (on a smaller scale)
    
Act 4:
  Consequences of knowledge:
    God is real, it's every thing and has gained senses into the universe with its asexual bodies
  Growing fear/anxiety:
    God lost full observer capabilities when sexual reproduction evolved
  Full knowledge (worst point):
    Our individual experiences are but a disease of the universe (Gnostic revelations)
    
Act 5:
  Final choice:
    Scientists inform the powerful elite that if we reproduce enough, we could overwhelm Gaia to prevent our extermination
  Final battle (climax):
    Gaia reacts by spreading virus that is able to selectively infect and eliminate those who want to destroy it
  Mastery of knowledge (resolution):
    Those remaining are happy to live in harmony with Gaia
